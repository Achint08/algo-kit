# Basic Data Structures And Algorithms

## Central idea behind this project

The idea is to focus on implementing basic important data structures and algorithms on very basic problems. These data structures are not exhaustive, but these are the algorithms that we occasionally come across.
This would help in two ways:

- Learn the exact insights and mechanisms about algorithms by heart.
- Developing Template for the common data structures and algorithms for later reuse.

Note:

1. When using python, use [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) in contests, if available, when solving questions because it's a faster alternative to cpython. Just read about it.

2. All FAANG companies mostly focus on these algorithms only. This are high leverage algorithms from the interview perspective.

I came across some new things about python while learning. You might also come across these at some time. Read these blogs for help understanding them, beforehand, so that you don't get stuck like me:

## Input size and time complexity reference

| Input size      | Target time complexity           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| n ≤ 12          | O(n!)                            |
| n ≤ 25          | O(2^n)                           |
| n ≤ 100         | O(n^4)                           |
| n ≤ 500         | O(n^3)                           |

## Suggestions

Are there any other algorithm that I might be missing? Please open a pull request and contribute! Let's learn together.
