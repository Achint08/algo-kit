# Basic Data Structures in different languages

## Central idea behind this project

The idea is to focus on implementing basic important data structures and algorithms on very basic problems. These data structures are not exhaustive, but these are the algorithms that we occasionally come across.
This would help in two ways:

- Learn the exact insights and mechanisms about algorithms by heart.
- Developing Template for the common data structures and algorithms for later reuse.

## List of languages

1. Python

## Key insights

1. Pass by reference for Array
2. In // operation used on array length, right always get the major elements.
3. Use truth table to avoid mistakes

## Suggestions

Are there any other algorithm that I might be missing? Please open a pull request and contribute! Let's learn together.

## Input size and time complexity reference

| Input size      | Target time complexity           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| n ≤ 12          | O(n!)                            |
| n ≤ 25          | O(2^n)                           |
| n ≤ 100         | O(n^4)                           |
| n ≤ 500         | O(n^3)                           |
| n ≤ 10 000      | O(n^2)                           |
