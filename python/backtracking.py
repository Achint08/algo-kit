# Backtracking is used, when we have to explore possibilities incrementally
# and make a decision based on solution of partial subproblem if we should continue
#  exploring the possibility or not. In short, there are two fundamental properties:
# 1. No repetition and completion
# 2. Search Pruning - Make a decision incrementally
